=========
For CyberBaldus v0.1

This computer is used in a small interplanetary delivery company. Only the authorized users in the list below should have 
access to this computer. Company policy is to disallow any media files, such as music, videos, or pictures from being stored 
in any user's account. Company policy is also that user passwords should be reasonably complex, but there currently might not 
be a system in place to ensure this. Furthermore, the root user should not be allowed to log in. If any administrators require 
elevated privileges, they should use sudo.

Users should be using the latest stable version of Firefox for their web browser. Administrators need to be able to log in 
to the computer using SSH, but any other remote access should be disallowed. Any hacking tools you find should be removed.

!!!IMPORTANT!!!
There isn't a scoring server for this image like in Cyberpatriots, but you can find your score at any time by running the 
command "score" in a terminal. Since the scoring script needs to access system configurations, you may be asked to provide
a password so it can elevate its privileges.
