For CyberBaldus v0.1

This computer is used in a small interplanetary delivery company. Only 
the authorized users in the list below should have access to this 
computer. Company policy is to disallow any media files, such as music, 
videos, or pictures from being stored in any user's account. 
Company policy is also that user passwords should be reasonably complex, 
but there currently might not be a system in place to ensure this. 
Furthermore, the root user should not be allowed to log in. If any 
administrators require elevated privileges, they should use sudo.

Users should be using the latest stable version of Firefox for their web 
browser. Administrators need to be able to log in to the computer using 
SSH, but any other remote access should be disallowed. Any hacking tools 
you find should be removed.
